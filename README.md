# Design Patterns and Principles

The website application has a simple and consistent design. Type, colour and layout are mostly consistent across all pages, including the style of elements like buttons and forms.

The navigation bar provides a clear hierarchy for users to easily move around the website. The use of a navbar toggler in the responsive layout makes it mobile friendly for users. The ability to expand and collpase the navigation bar further enhances functionality on smaller devices.

The Task List follows the “F” Pattern design principle which mimics the natural pattern of reading (left to right, top to bottom) that works with people's natural pattern of scanning a page.

# Iterations

### Resource List

The Resource List page was re-designed to have more functionality and customisation.

A form was added to the Resource List page where users could add their own categories when adding sources. This addition was in response to receving feedback from tutors that suggested to have an option to tag or group resources. The cards are organised through colours which represent its category. This helps the user to quickly scan the resources and see what cards are grouped together.

Additionally, a tabs bar was created where individual categories can be viewed only. This helps the user if they want to focus on only one group at a time.

### Kanban Board

The kanban board was re-designed to be more practical to use.

The mockups intially had the "Add Task" at the bottom of the cards. Feedback from tutors suggested to have a single "Add" button at the top of a column for more practicality. For example if a user has many cards in one column, they will have to scroll down to add a task, but by having the button at the top it makes it more conveniant for the user.

### Navigation Bar

The mockups originally had no navigation bar, but with tabs and popovers instead. After self-reflection, these were all condensed into a single navigation bar in the header of the website. This change makes it easier for users to navigate the website as features were previously in different locations, making it harder to locate.

# Layout changes to make it responsive

Changing the layout when adding the navigation bar, made the website easier to be responsive on mobile. On mobile devices the navigation bar condenses to a hamburger icon which created a neater look. From this users have a clearer focal point.
